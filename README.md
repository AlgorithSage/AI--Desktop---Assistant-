# AI--Desktop---Assistant-
Our Desktop AI Assistant uses Python, ChatGPT API, speech recognition, and text-to-speech to answer voice commands. It can respond to queries and open apps like YouTube, Google, Spotify, and moreâ€”bringing smart, hands-free control to your PC.

Our Desktop AI Assistant is a smart, voice-activated application designed to streamline everyday computer interactions. Built using Python, it integrates speech recognition, text-to-speech (TTS), and OpenAI's ChatGPT API to deliver natural language conversations.

Users can ask questions via voice, and the assistant responds in real time using ChatGPT's powerful language model. It can also perform system-level tasks like:

1) Opening YouTube, Google, Spotify, or any installed applications
2) Answering general knowledge queries
3) Providing conversational assistance

The project leverages:

1. speech_recognition for capturing voice input
2. pyttsx3 or gTTS for voice output
3. openai for generating ChatGPT-based responses
4. os, webbrowser, and subprocess for system and browser-level operations

It brings the convenience of a personal assistant right to your desktop through an intelligent and intuitive interface.
